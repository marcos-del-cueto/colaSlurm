# colaSlurm
 -- Simple script to get info about queue system

 -- Quickly shows info about user's jobs (-u), info about specific
    partitions (-p) and general usage of slurm system (-s), with 
    style based on savail by A S Muzas

 -- Script is home-made and is certainly not optimized. Feel free to
    share any improvements

 -- Can be executed simply with: $> ./colaSlurm

 -- For convenience, can be moved to a directory that belongs to the user's path
